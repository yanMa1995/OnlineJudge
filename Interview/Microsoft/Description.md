# Description

## 合并两个排序链表

Question: Write a function (in C#, C++, Java or Python) to merge two already sorted linked lists, **do not use recursion**.

It takes in two already sorted linked lists (in ascendant order, duplicates allowed) and is supposed to merge them into a single sorted linked list (in ascendant order, duplicates allowed) and returns the new head.

Given a data structure:

```c++
class Node {
public:
	int data;
	Node* next;
};
```
